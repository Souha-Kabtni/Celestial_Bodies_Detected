## Classifying Celestial Bodies According to their Spectral Properties

The categorization of stars, galaxies, and quasars based on their spectral properties is a crucial concept in astronomy. By dividing stars into different categories based on factors such as their temperature, luminosity, and chemical composition, we can gain insight into their physical properties and evolutionary stages.
